# pristinawang-Orchid-Types-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

Jupyter notebook and data files are available in master branch.

Built a CNN model to classify 219 orchid types with 2190 images (10 images per class) with Keras and TensorFlow. Increased the amount of data with image augmentation with Keraâ€™s ImageDataGenerator. Applied transfer learning with InceptionResnetV2 model(previously trained on Imagenet) and finetuned the last 3 layers of the base model. 
Resulted in 0.76 accuracy and 0.56 validation accuracy.
